Report for Lab 3
----------------

Answer the questions from the lab description here.  Questions 8 and 9 do not require answers.

1.	Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, Operator, OrderBy, Project, SeqScan, TupleIterator

2.	Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, OrderBy, Project

3.	HashEquiJoin and Join = join, Project = project, Filter = select, so just join, select, and project. 

4.	Filter is a subclass of Operator, and is therefore not required to implement close, next or hasNext; it will inherit these methods from Operator.

5.	t = current tuple under consideration 	//assume that there was a match before or t is null
	while(iterR.hasNext()){ 				//as long as there is another element in the iterator
		t = iterR.next()
		if t matches predicate:
			return t
	}
	return null 							//did not find any elements matching the predicate	

6.	list = []
	r = iterR current element; s = iterS current element
	while(iterR.hasNext()){
		r = iterR.next()
		while(iterS.hasNext()){
			s = iterS.next()
			if r & s match predicate:
				list.append(merge(r, s))
		}
		iterS.rewind()
	}
	return list

7.	if t1 == null:
		while(iterR.hasNext()){
			t1 = iterR.next()
			while(iterS.hasNext()){
				t2 = iterS.next()
				if t1 & t2 match predicate:
					return merge(t1, t2)
			}
			iterS.rewind()
		}
	else:
		while(iterS.hasNext()){
			t2 = iterS.next()
			if t1 & t2 match predicate:
				return merge(t1, t2)
		}
		iterS.rewind()
		t1 = null
		join
	return null								//did not find any elements matching the predicate
