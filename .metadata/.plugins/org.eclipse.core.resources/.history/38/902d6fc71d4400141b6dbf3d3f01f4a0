Report for Lab 1
----------------

After you complete lab 1, please answer the following questions.  For lab 1, the questions are simple but in future labs you can expect to spend some time answering more detailed questions about the design of your solution.

1. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

Adam Becker

2. What did you think of this assignment?

I think that the idea of building our own database is great, but I have been frustrated with getting some of the parts to work correctly.

3. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

The HeapFile Iterator.

4. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

There's something going wrong with my HeapFile iterator that I can't figure out, there seems to be a problem when I call getPage with my BufferPool.
When I try to debug with excercise 7 as suggested, I run this line java -classpath dist/simpledb.jar simpledb.Lab1Main and nothing happens. I'm not really sure what's going on...
I've also implemented some of the basic methods in SeqScan but don't know what to do with open or close.

5. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

~10-12 hours?
